#Problem 8: Cumulative sum of a list [a, b, c, ...] is defined as [a, a+b, a+b+c, ...]. Write a function cumulative_sum to compute cumulative sum of a list. Does your implementation work for a list of strings?


def cum_sum(lst):
     result=[]
     total=o
     for items in lst:
          total+=item
          result.append(total)
    return result


print(cum_sum([1,2,3,4]))
